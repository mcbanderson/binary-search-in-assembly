# binary-search-in-assembly
Written for the 80x86 family of processors to be run on 16bit DOS. (Tested using DOSBox).

Prompts the user to enter an integer, then performs a binary search of a hard coded array. Returns the array index of the integer if found, or a failure message if the array doesn't contain the search value. Requires irvine.lib (not included in this repository).
